This is an implementation of JSON to YAML converter written in Go language.
This tool efficiently converts each JSON tokens in streaming fashion, so it avoids loading the entire JSON on the memory.
Also, this tool preserves the order of mapping keys and the number representation.

## Usage as a command line tool
```bash
json2yaml file.json ...
json2yaml <file.json >output.yaml
```

You can combine with other command line tools.
```bash
gh api /meta | json2yaml | less
```

## Usage as a library
You can use the converter as a Go library.
[`json2yaml.Convert(io.Writer, io.Reader) error`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/itchyny/json2yaml#Convert) is exported.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"strings"

	"github.com/itchyny/json2yaml"
)

func main() {
	input := strings.NewReader(`{"Hello": "world!"}`)
	var output strings.Builder
	if err := json2yaml.Convert(&output, input); err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}
	fmt.Print(output.String()) // outputs Hello: world!
}
```
